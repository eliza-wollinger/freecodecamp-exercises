          <p>Mong is a 2021 project created for a hackathon with the objective of solving the problem of raising funds for third sector companies. Our general focus, in addition to fundraising, is to provide a more balanced and sustainable ecosystem that better meets the needs of donors, where part of all investments and income made in the currency will go to the maintenance of NGOs.</p>
          <p>
            In the spirit of many open source projects, Mong just started by solving the initial problem in a new way, always following design principles and coding best practices. Like:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Facilitated platform to improve issues such as usability and accessibility.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Development in a decentralized way.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Thinking about environmental issues, we use Proof of Stake technology.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                We take advantage of the blockchain's ability to be like a cash book, and we make all transactions transparent, with an immutable history.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                We want to give a voice to those who need it most.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
          Proof of Stake (<code>PoS</code>) was introduced in mid-2011 on the Bitcointalk forum as a way to solve the problems of the most popular algorithm in use today, Proof of Work (<code>PoW</code>). While both share the goal of reaching consensus within the blockchain, the process for achieving it is different between these ways.
          </p>
          <p>
            In systems based on Proof of Work, the value depends on how much energy it takes to mine a single block, and computers compete with each other to see who is the first to mine it, thus generating enormous environmental pollution.
          </p>
          <p>
            
We don't want to have another coin to pollute our planet, focused on bringing only good things with the creation of Mong, we use Proof of Stake technology, where the value of coins is determined by the amount of investment in the pools.
          </p>

          <p>
            Cryptocurrencies are an excellent example of the social factor related to money, we always see a whole community engaged behind it, and why not use all this engagement to do good? And that's how Mong came to be, a new cryptocurrency, but with a giant thought: giving a voice to people in need.
          </p>
          <p>
            So we joined two communities to bring the best: helping others, you help and you earn from it.

          <p>
            For the creation of the blockchain, pure <code>JavaScript</code> with <code>NodeJS</code> was used, due to the agility of development that these two tools allow. And for our platform, <code>ReactJS</code> and <code>TypeScript</code> were used.
