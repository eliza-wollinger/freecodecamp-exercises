Following the advice of the director of the Polytechnic, he attended a Swiss school to complete high school, and the following year he began his studies at college.</p>

            <p>Einstein got his bachelor's degree in physics and mathematics. But during his graduation, he missed his classes to stay in the labs, and he never paid much attention to his professors. And so, he was even turned down for a job as a lab assistant. He ended up getting a job at the Swiss Patent Office, which he got with the help of a friend of his father.</p>

            <p>The first work was released in March, and in it there was a shocking hypothesis, despite decades of evidence that light was a wave, Einstein proposed that it was actually a <b class="medium">particle</b>.

            <p>Two months later, in May, he did a study on the <b class="medium">existence of atoms</b>, although some theories were based on the idea of invisible atoms, many scientists still believed it was fiction. But Eisstein used a clever argument to convince them: he showed that the behavior of small particles moving randomly in a liquid medium, known as Brownian motion, could be predicted by the collision of millions of invisible atoms.</p>

            <p>The third work was published in June, and it came about due to a problem Einstein had with the inconsistency between two fundamental principles of physics: the principle of relativity, said that absolute motion could not be defined, but in electromagnetic theory, it stated that he existed. The discrepancy between these questions brought Einstein into what he called psychic tension. After much debate on the subject, Einstein realized that this contradiction could be resolved if the speed of light remained constant, regardless of the frame of reference adopted. And he formulated what became known as <b class="medium">special relativity.</b></p>

            <p>In September he published his fourth work, which was a kind of complement to the work of relativity. Taking a closer look at his earlier work, Albert realized that it also meant that <b class="medium">mass and energy were equivalent</b>. And his relationship could be represented by the equation that marked his life and history:</p>

            <p>During a visit to the United States, Einstein decided not to return to Germany due to the Nazi Party's rise to power with its new chancellor Adolf Hitler. But after a while he returned by ship to Belgium at the end of March, during the voyage he was informed that his home had been invaded by the Nazis and his personal sailboat confiscated. Upon disembarking, he immediately went to the German consulate where he presented his passport and formally renounced German citizenship. On the same day he sent a letter in which he submitted his resignation to the Prussian Academy in Berlin. In early April, he learned that the new German government had instituted laws that prohibited Jews from holding official positions, including teaching at universities.</p>

A month later, Einstein's works were among the Nazi book-burning targets, and the Joseph Goebbels Propaganda Ministry proclaimed, "Jewish intellectualism is dead." Einstein also learned that his name was on an assassination target list, with a "$5,000 bounty on his head." A German magazine included him in a list of enemies of the regime with the phrase "not yet hanged".</p>
